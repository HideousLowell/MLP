    <h1>DOCUMENTATION MLP</h1>
    <h2>LET'S GO!</h2>
    <p>MLP - is an application that allows you to learn and use Multilayer Perceptron to classify hand-writed letters.
    </p>
    <h4>BASIC APP FUNCTIONS:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Drawing area, where you can scratch anything you want and MLP will try to predict the letter you wrote</li>
        <li>Uploading image from bmp-file (up to 512x512 pixels)</li>
        <li>MLP setting window</li>
        <li>Learning section, where you can try to learn your own MLP</li>
        <li>Tests section, where you may test your MLP</li>
        <li>Saving & uploading section. Here you can save your MLP learn progress to local file</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>EXAMPLE:</h4>

    <h5>AbOBa</h5>
    <h4>HOW TO USE:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>First, when you start a program, MLP is unlearned. You need to configure and press
            "START LEARNING" or load weights from local file that was made earlier.</li>
        <li>Then you can scratch anything on drawing area or load image from bmp-file and see how MLP is
            trying to predict a letter.</li>
        <li>You can test your MLP by choosing a selection part of tests number and click "START TESTS".</li>
        <li>If you need something different, you can try to configure your MLP in "Setting" window by
            pressing button with shaft button.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>RECOMENDATION:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't choose more than 2 number of epochs or groups k, because you'll need a lot of time to wait.</li>
        <li>Don't use large bmp-files. Up to 512x512 pixels.</li>
        <li>Draw letters in center and almost at full size of area.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>LET'S TALK ABOUT SETTING</h3>
    <p>Setting - This is a feature of the application that allows you to configure it.</p>

    <h4>BASIC SETTING:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Realization of MLP: Matrix or Graph</li>
        <li>Count of hidden layers: from 2 to 5</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>RECOMENDATION:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Bigger number of hidden layers - better the result ;)</li>
        <li>That's all</li>
    </ul>
